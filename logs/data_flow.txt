Starting with:
1. 391 trials with aggregate-level data from AACT (pulled in from project_data repo)
2. 92 IPD trials with aggregate-level data (from Vivli)


Modification 1
Removed IPD trials from AACT set, replacing with IPD aggregate data
AACT: 391 -> 299

Modification 2
Removed three trials where the comparator was multiple older blood glucose-lowering agents categorised as A10B. Non-informative.

Modification 3
Removed trials where there was only one treatment class (i.e. dpp4 vs dpp4)
AACT: 296 -> 272

Objective 1:
388 trials - 296 AACT, 92 IPD

Objective 2:
