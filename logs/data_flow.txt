Starting with:
1. 391 trials with aggregate-level data from AACT (pulled in from project_data repo)
2. 92 IPD trials with aggregate-level data (from Vivli)


Modification 1
Removed IPD trials from AACT set, replacing with IPD aggregate data
AACT: 391 -> 299

Modification 2
Removed three trials where the comparator was multiple older blood glucose-lowering agents categorised as A10B. Non-informative.
AACT: 299 -> 296

Modification 3
Removed two trials where interaction estimates were greater than +/- 10, or where standard errors were greater than +/- 2
IPD: 92 -> 56

Objective 1:
388 trials - 296 AACT, 92 IPD

Objective 2:
56 IPD
