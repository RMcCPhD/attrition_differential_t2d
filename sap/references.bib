	abstract = {Type 2 diabetes is a chronic and progressive cardiometabolic disorder that affects more than 10\% of adults worldwide and is a major cause of morbidity, mortality, disability, and high costs. Over the past decade, the pattern of management of diabetes has shifted from a predominantly glucose centric approach, focused on lowering levels of haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), to a directed complications centric approach, aimed at preventing short term and long term complications of diabetes, and a pathogenesis centric approach, which looks at the underlying metabolic dysfunction of excess adiposity that both causes and complicates the management of diabetes. In this review, we discuss the latest advances in patient centred care for type 2 diabetes, focusing on drug and non-drug approaches to reducing the risks of complications of diabetes in adults. We also discuss the effects of social determinants of health on the management of diabetes, particularly as they affect the treatment of hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes.},

Through updated and improved best practices informed by recent evidence and described herein, we stand to better attain A1c targets, help preserve beta cell integrity and moderate glycemic variability, minimize treatment-emergent hypoglycemia, circumvent prescribing to “treatment failure,” and prevent long-term complications. The first topic addressed in this review concerns updates in the 2023 and 2024 diabetes treatment guidelines for which further elaboration can help facilitate integration into routine care. The second concerns advances in diabetes research that have not yet found their way into guidelines, though they are endorsed by strong evidence and are ready for real-world use in appropriate patients. The final theme addresses lingering misconceptions about the underpinnings of type 2 diabetes—fundamental fallacies that continue to be asserted in the textbooks and continuing medical education upon which physicians build their approaches. A corrected and up-to-date understanding of the disease state is essential for practitioners to both conceptually and translationally manage initial onset through late-stage type 2 diabetes.},

	abstract = {Introduction Participants in randomised controlled trials (trials) are generally younger and healthier than many individuals encountered in clinical practice. Consequently, the applicability of trial findings is often uncertain. To address this, results from trials can be calibrated to more representative data sources. In a network meta-analysis, using a novel approach which allows the inclusion of trials whether or not individual-level participant data (IPD) is available, we will calibrate trials for three drug classes (sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) receptor analogues and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors) to the Scottish diabetes register.
Methods and analysis Medline and EMBASE databases, the US clinical trials registry (clinicaltrials.gov) and the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (chictr.org.cn) will be searched from 1 January 2002. Two independent reviewers will apply eligibility criteria to identify trials for inclusion. Included trials will be phase 3 or 4 trials of SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP1 receptor analogues or DPP4 inhibitors, with placebo or active comparators, in participants with type 2 diabetes, with at least one of glycaemic control, change in body weight or major adverse cardiovascular event as outcomes. Unregistered trials will be excluded.We have identified a target population from the population-based Scottish diabetes register. The chosen cohort comprises people in Scotland with type 2 diabetes who either (1) require further treatment due to poor glycaemic control where any of the three drug classes may be suitable, or (2) who have adequate glycaemic control but are already on one of the three drug classes of interest or insulin.
Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval for IPD use was obtained from the University of Glasgow MVLS College Ethics Committee (Project: 200160070). The Scottish diabetes register has approval from the Scottish A Research Ethics Committee (11/AL/0225) and operates with Public Benefit and Privacy Panel for Health and Social Care approval (1617-0147).

	abstract = {Objective To compare the benefits and harms of drug treatments for adults with type 2 diabetes, adding non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (including finerenone) and tirzepatide (a dual glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist) to previously existing treatment options.
Design Systematic review and network meta-analysis.
Data sources Ovid Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central up to 14 October 2022.
Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Eligible randomised controlled trials compared drugs of interest in adults with type 2 diabetes. Eligible trials had a follow-up of 24 weeks or longer. Trials systematically comparing combinations of more than one drug treatment class with no drug, subgroup analyses of randomised controlled trials, and non-English language studies were deemed ineligible. Certainty of evidence was assessed following the GRADE (grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluation) approach.
Results The analysis identified 816 trials with 471 038 patients, together evaluating 13 different drug classes; all subsequent estimates refer to the comparison with standard treatments. Sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors (odds ratio 0.88, 95\% confidence interval 0.83 to 0.94; high certainty) and GLP-1 receptor agonists (0.88, 0.82 to 0.93; high certainty) reduce all cause death; non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, so far tested only with finerenone in patients with chronic kidney disease, probably reduce mortality (0.89, 0.79 to 1.00; moderate certainty); other drugs may not. The study confirmed the benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists in reducing cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, admission to hospital for heart failure, and end stage kidney disease. Finerenone probably reduces admissions to hospital for heart failure and end stage kidney disease, and possibly cardiovascular death. Only GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce non-fatal stroke; SGLT-2 inhibitors are superior to other drugs in reducing end stage kidney disease. GLP-1 receptor agonists and probably SGLT-2 inhibitors and tirzepatide improve quality of life. Reported harms were largely specific to drug class (eg, genital infections with SGLT-2 inhibitors, severe gastrointestinal adverse events with tirzepatide and GLP-1 receptor agonists, hyperkalaemia leading to admission to hospital with finerenone). Tirzepatide probably results in the largest reduction in body weight (mean difference −8.57 kg; moderate certainty). Basal insulin (mean difference 2.15 kg; moderate certainty) and thiazolidinediones (mean difference 2.81 kg; moderate certainty) probably result in the largest increases in body weight. Absolute benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, and finerenone vary in people with type 2 diabetes, depending on baseline risks for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes (https://matchit.magicevidence.org/230125dist-diabetes).
Conclusions This network meta-analysis extends knowledge beyond confirming the substantial benefits with the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists in reducing adverse cardiovascular and kidney outcomes and death by adding information on finerenone and tirzepatide. These findings highlight the need for continuous assessment of scientific progress to introduce cutting edge updates in clinical practice guidelines for people with type 2 diabetes.

	abstract = {Objective To evaluate sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists in patients with type 2 diabetes at varying cardiovascular and renal risk.
Design Network meta-analysis.
Data sources Medline, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL up to 11 August 2020.
Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Randomised controlled trials comparing SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists with placebo, standard care, or other glucose lowering treatment in adults with type 2 diabetes with follow up of 24 weeks or longer. Studies were screened independently by two reviewers for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias.
Main outcome measures Frequentist random effects network meta-analysis was carried out and GRADE (grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation) used to assess evidence certainty. Results included estimated absolute effects of treatment per 1000 patients treated for five years for patients at very low risk (no cardiovascular risk factors), low risk (three or more cardiovascular risk factors), moderate risk (cardiovascular disease), high risk (chronic kidney disease), and very high risk (cardiovascular disease and kidney disease). A guideline panel provided oversight of the systematic review.
Results 764 trials including 421 346 patients proved eligible. All results refer to the addition of SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists to existing diabetes treatment. Both classes of drugs lowered all cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and kidney failure (high certainty evidence). Notable differences were found between the two agents: SGLT-2 inhibitors reduced admission to hospital for heart failure more than GLP-1 receptor agonists, and GLP-1 receptor agonists reduced non-fatal stroke more than SGLT-2 inhibitors (which appeared to have no effect). SGLT-2 inhibitors caused genital infection (high certainty), whereas GLP-1 receptor agonists might cause severe gastrointestinal events (low certainty). Low certainty evidence suggested that SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists might lower body weight. Little or no evidence was found for the effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists on limb amputation, blindness, eye disease, neuropathic pain, or health related quality of life. The absolute benefits of these drugs vary substantially across patients from low to very high risk of cardiovascular and renal outcomes (eg, SGLT-2 inhibitors resulted in 3 to 40 fewer deaths in 1000 patients over five years; see interactive decision support tool (https://magicevidence.org/match-it/200820dist/\#!/) for all outcomes.
Conclusions In patients with type 2 diabetes, SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists reduced cardiovascular and renal outcomes, with some differences in benefits and harms. Absolute benefits are determined by individual risk profiles of patients, with clear implications for clinical practice, as reflected in the BMJ Rapid Recommendations directly informed by this systematic review.

              Materials and methods
              
                Patients (previously drug‐naive or using one oral antidiabetic drug for ≥ 12 weeks) entered an open‐label stabilization period (16 weeks, Empa 10 mg [Part A] or Empa 25 mg [Part B]).

Over 24‐ and 52‐week periods, higher proportions of patients achieved HbA1c {\textless} 7.0\% and greater decreases in fasting plasma glucose were observed with Empa/Lina compared with Empa/Plc. Empa/Lina was well tolerated, with no unexpected adverse events or diabetic ketoacidosis. One case of confirmed hypoglycaemia with Empa/Plc 25/5 was reported.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              
                These results support Empa/Lina FDC as a potential option for Japanese patients with T2DM who require combination therapy.

              To compare the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin vs glimepiride as add‐on to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes.
            
            
              Research design and methods
              
                This 52‐week, multicentre, double‐blind, active‐controlled study (NCT02471404) randomized (1:1:1) patients (
                n
                = 939; HbA1c 7.5\%‐10.5\%) on metformin monotherapy (≥1500 mg/day) to add‐on dapagliflozin 10 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg plus saxagliptin 5 mg, or glimepiride 1 to 6 mg (titrated). The primary efficacy end point was change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 52.
              
            
            
              Results
              Baseline mean age, diabetes duration and HbA1c were 58.4 years, 7.0 years and 8.3\%, respectively. Adjusted mean HbA1c change from baseline was −1.20\% with dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin and −0.82\% with dapagliflozin, vs −0.99\% with glimepiride (mean dose at Week 52, 4.6 mg). Changes in body weight (−3.2 kg and −3.5 kg vs +1.8 kg) and systolic blood pressure (SBP; −6.4 mm Hg and −5.6 mm Hg vs −1.6 mm Hg) were significantly greater with dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin and dapagliflozin than with glimepiride. FPG decreased significantly with dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin compared with glimepiride (−2.1 mmol/L vs −1.5 mmol/L) and was similar with dapagliflozin (−1.6 mmol/L) compared with glimepiride. Confirmed incidence of hypoglycaemia was lower with dapagliflozin regimens than with glimepiride (0 and 1 vs 13 patients) and fewer patients required rescue. Genital infections were more frequent with dapagliflozin; other AE profiles were similar.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Dapagliflozin, saxagliptin and metformin improved glycaemic control compared with glimepiride plus metformin; add‐on of dapagliflozin alone showed efficacy similar to that of glimepiride. Both dapagliflozin regimens decreased body weight and SBP, with a lower incidence of hypoglycaemia compared with glimepiride.},

              To evaluate the efficacy and safety of linagliptin vs placebo as add‐on to empagliflozin and metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes.
            
            
              Materials and methods
              
                Patients with inadequate glycaemic control despite stable‐dose metformin received open‐label empagliflozin 10 mg (study 1) or 25 mg (study 2) as add‐on therapy for 16 weeks. Subsequently, those with
                HbA1c
                ≥7.0 and ≤10.5\% ({\textgreater}53 and ≤91 mmol/mol) (N = 482) were randomized to 24 weeks’ double‐blind, double‐dummy treatment with linagliptin 5 mg or placebo in study 1, or to linagliptin 5 mg or placebo in study 2; all patients continued treatment with metformin and empagliflozin 10 mg (study 1) or metformin and empagliflozin 25 mg (study 2). The primary endpoint was change from baseline (defined as the last value before first intake of randomized, double‐blind treatment) in
                HbA1c
                at week 24.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                At week 24,
                HbA1c
                (mean baseline 7.82‐8.04 [62‐64 mmol/mol]) was significantly reduced with linagliptin vs placebo; adjusted mean (
                SE
                ) differences in change from baseline in
                HbA1c
                with linagliptin vs placebo were −.32\% (.10) (−3.59 [1.08] mmol/mol) (
                P
                = .001) for patients on empagliflozin 10 mg and metformin, and −0.47\% (0.10) (−5.15 [1.04] mmol/mol) (
                P
                {\textless} 0.001) for patients on empagliflozin 25 mg and metformin. Adverse events were reported in more patients receiving placebo than in those receiving linagliptin: 55.5\% vs 48.4\% in study 1 and 58.9\% vs 52.7\% in study 2.

              The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of triple therapy with saxagliptin add-on versus placebo add-on to dapagliflozin plus metformin in adults with type 2 diabetes.
            
            
              RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
              Patients on stable metformin (≥1,500 mg/day) for ≥8 weeks with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 8.0–11.5\% (64–102 mmol/mol) at screening received open-label dapagliflozin (10 mg/day) plus metformin immediate release (IR) for 16 weeks. Patients with inadequate glycemic control (HbA1c 7–10.5\% [53–91 mmol/mol]) were then randomized to receive placebo (n = 153) or saxagliptin 5 mg/day (n = 162) in addition to background dapagliflozin plus metformin IR. The primary efficacy end point was change in HbA1c from baseline to week 24.
            
            
              RESULTS
              There was a significantly greater reduction in HbA1c at 24 weeks with saxagliptin add-on (–0.51\% [–5.6 mmol/mol]) versus placebo (–0.16\% [–1.7 mmol/mol]) add-on to dapagliflozin plus metformin (difference, –0.35\% [95\% CI –0.52\% to –0.18\%] and –3.8 [–5.7 to –2.0 mmol/mol], respectively; P \&lt; 0.0001). Reductions in fasting plasma glucose and 2-h postprandial glucose were similar between treatment arms. A larger proportion of patients achieved HbA1c \&lt;7\% (53 mmol/mol) with saxagliptin add-on (35.3\%) versus placebo add-on (23.1\%) to dapagliflozin plus metformin. Adverse events were similar between treatment groups. Episodes of hypoglycemia were infrequent in both treatment arms, and there were no episodes of major hypoglycemia.
            
            
              CONCLUSIONS
              Triple therapy with the addition of saxagliptin to dapagliflozin plus metformin was well tolerated and produced significant improvements in HbA1c in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with dapagliflozin plus metformin.},

	abstract = {Standard network meta-analysis (NMA) and indirect comparisons combine aggregate data from multiple studies on treatments of interest, assuming that any effect modifiers are balanced across populations. Population adjustment methods relax this assumption using individual patient data from one or more studies. However, current matching-adjusted indirect comparison and simulated treatment comparison methods are limited to pairwise indirect comparisons and cannot predict into a specified target population. Existing meta-regression approaches incur aggregation bias. We propose a new method extending the standard NMA framework. An individual level regression model is defined, and aggregate data are fitted by integrating over the covariate distribution to form the likelihood. Motivated by the complexity of the closed form integration, we propose a general numerical approach using quasi-Monte-Carlo integration. Covariate correlation structures are accounted for by using copulas. Crucially for decision making, comparisons may be provided in any target population with a given covariate distribution. We illustrate the method with a network of plaque psoriasis treatments. Estimated population-average treatment effects are similar across study populations, as differences in the distributions of effect modifiers are small. A better fit is achieved than a random effects NMA, uncertainty is substantially reduced by explaining within- and between-study variation, and estimates are more interpretable.},

	abstract = {Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors improve hyperglycemia, and SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) among individuals with type 2 diabetes. It is not clear whether efficacy varies by age or sex.To assess whether age or sex are associated with differences in the efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, and DPP4 inhibitors.The MEDLINE and Embase databases and US and Chinese clinical trial registries were searched for articles published from inception to November 2022; in August 2024, the search was updated to capture the trial results. Two reviewers screened for randomized clinical trials of SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, or DPP4 inhibitors vs a placebo or active comparator in adults with type 2 diabetes.Individual participant data and aggregate data were used to estimate age × treatment interactions and sex × treatment interactions in multilevel network meta-regression models.Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and MACEs.Of the 601 eligible trials identified (592 trials with 309 503 participants reported HbA1c; mean age, 58.9 [SD, 10.8] years; 42.3\% were female and 23 trials with 168 489 participants reported MACEs; mean age, 64.0 [SD, 8.6] years; 35.3\% were female), individual participant data were obtained for 103 trials (103 reported HbA1c and 6 reported MACEs). The use of SGLT2 inhibitors (vs placebo) was associated with less HbA1c lowering with increasing age for monotherapy (absolute reduction [AR], 0.24\% [95\% credible interval \{CrI\}, 0.10\% to 0.38\%] per 30-year increment in age), for dual therapy (AR, 0.17\% [95\% CrI, 0.10\% to 0.24\%]), and for triple therapy (AR, 0.25\% [95\% CrI, 0.20\% to 0.30\%]). The use of GLP-1 receptor agonists was associated with greater HbA1c lowering with increasing age for monotherapy (AR, −0.18\% [95\% CrI, −0.31\% to −0.05\%] per 30-year increment in age) and for dual therapy (AR, −0.24\% [95\% CrI, −0.40\% to −0.07\%]), but not for triple therapy (AR, 0.04\% [95\% CrI, −0.02\% to 0.11\%]). The use of DPP4 inhibitors was associated with slightly better HbA1c lowering in older people for dual therapy (AR, −0.09\% [95\% CrI, −0.15\% to −0.03\%] per 30-year increment in age), but not for monotherapy (AR, −0.08\% [95\% CrI, −0.18\% to 0.01\%]) or triple therapy (AR, −0.01\% [95\% CrI, −0.06\% to 0.05\%]). The relative reduction in MACEs with use of SGLT2 inhibitors was greater in older vs younger participants per 30-year increment in age (hazard ratio, 0.76 [95\% CrI, 0.62 to 0.93]), and the relative reduction in MACEs with use of GLP-1 receptor agonists was less in older vs younger participants (hazard ratio, 1.47 [95\% CrI, 1.07 to 2.02]). There was no consistent evidence for sex × treatment interactions with use of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists.The SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists were associated with lower risk of MACEs. Analysis of age × treatment interactions suggested that SGLT2 inhibitors were more cardioprotective in older than in younger people despite smaller reductions in HbA1c; GLP-1 receptor agonists were more cardioprotective in younger people.},

	abstract = {Pooling of direct and indirect evidence from randomized trials, known as mixed treatment comparisons (MTC), is becoming increasingly common in the clinical literature. MTC allows coherent judgements on which of the several treatments is the most effective and produces estimates of the relative effects of each treatment compared with every other treatment in a network. We introduce two methods for checking consistency of direct and indirect evidence. The first method (back-calculation) infers the contribution of indirect evidence from the direct evidence and the output of an MTC analysis and is useful when the only available data consist of pooled summaries of the pairwise contrasts. The second more general, but computationally intensive, method is based on ‘node-splitting’ which separates evidence on a particular comparison (node) into ‘direct’ and ‘indirect’ and can be applied to networks where trial-level data are available. Methods are illustrated with examples from the literature. We take a hierarchical Bayesian approach to MTC implemented using WinBUGS and R. We show that both methods are useful in identifying potential inconsistencies in different types of network and that they illustrate how the direct and indirect evidence combine to produce the posterior MTC estimates of relative treatment effects. This allows users to understand how MTC synthesis is pooling the data, and what is ‘driving’ the final estimates. We end with some considerations on the modelling assumptions being made, the problems with the extension of the back-calculation method to trial-level data and discuss our methods in the context of the existing literature.
